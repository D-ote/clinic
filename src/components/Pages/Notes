Enable Layer Mask from the Layer menu does not create a new mask - it turns on an existing 
one that had been turned off. It's greyed out because your layer doesn't currently have a mask,
 so there is nothing to enable.To create a new 
layer mask, select your layer and click the Layer Mask icon in at the bottom of the Layers panel.
